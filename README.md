# SiMPle-Fast-Extension
An implementation of the SiMPle-Fast method for retrieving similarity matrix profiles on multi-dimensional data. This implementation includes cosine distance as an additional metric. Furthermore, instead of returning the best single window match, this implementation can return an arbitrary top 'x' matches per window in ascending order.
