# SiMPle-Fast-Extension
Two implementations of the SiMPle-Fast method for retrieving similarity matrix profiles on multi-dimensional data. These implementations include cosine distance as an additional metric. Furthermore, instead of returning the best single match per window, these implementations retrieve an arbitrary top 'x' matches per window in ascending order.
